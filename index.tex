With this library, you don\textquotesingle{}t have to worry about manually allocating (or freeing) memory. Everything can be done using the given set of functions.

This library manages {\bfseries circular}, {\bfseries doubly-\/linked} lists

It lets you do the following operations\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Create} a list
\item Get the list {\bfseries size}
\item {\bfseries Sort} a list
\item {\bfseries Add data} to a list
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item At a given index (positive, or negative)
\item At the end of the list (append)
\item At the front of the list (push\+\_\+front)
\item Through a pre-\/made node, or not
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Display} a list\textquotesingle{}s content
\item {\bfseries Free} memory
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The list\textquotesingle{}s head, and its nodes
\item The list, its nodes, and the data
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Optimized iteration functions
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Folding functions (inspired by Haskell\textquotesingle{}s foldl/foldr)
\item Mapping functions (inspired by Javascript\textquotesingle{}s map)
\item Filter function
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

As you may know, C is quite a {\bfseries low-\/level} programming language. It doesn\textquotesingle{}t have dynamic memory management unlike its big brother C++.

This library was developped in order to {\bfseries make life easier} to any dev who often manages big chunks of data.

To be more precise, this library was developped while my first and second year at E\+P\+I\+T\+E\+CH ({\itshape European Institure of Technology}). During those years, in order to fully comprehend memory principles, we programmed multiple projects using C language.

This library can also serve as a {\bfseries source of inspiration} for any {\itshape E\+P\+I\+T\+E\+CH} or {\itshape 42} student who would like to {\bfseries code their own C containers}.

If you are a first or second student in one of those schools, {\bfseries DO N\+OT copy-\/paste the code}, you might find yourself in some very {\bfseries unpleasant situations}...
